            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSITIONS FROM The <hi>ADJƲTATORS</hi> of five Regiaments of Horse, Drawn up to be presented to the Generall Councell of the ARMY at <hi>Putney,</hi> this present Thursday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1647.</head>
            <p n="1">I. FIrst, that all the orders, Votes, Ordinances or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, that have passed either to discountenance petitions, suppresse, prevent or burne petitions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison or declare against petitioners, being dangerous presidents against the freedome of the people, may be forthwith expunged out of the Journall books, and the injustice of them clearely declared to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that in such a Declaration the Souldiery be vindicated, as to the right and equity of their first pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, all those large summes of money that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to needlesse pretended Officers of the Court,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161228:3"/>which did but increase wickednesse and prophannesse, may be reserved for a publique treasure to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in paying those Lords that must be maintained, for the peoples safety, and whereas there is now 50 pound <hi>per diem,</hi> allowed for the Court, who offered that there might be three hundred pound <hi>per diem,</hi> allowed for the Court, to be paid out of the publique treasury, through a good and faithfull improvement of all the Lands pertaining to the Court, there must be as much reserved for levying the publique charges, and easing the people.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And it is further offered, that whereas millions of money, have been kept in dead stock in the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Halls and Companies, and the free men of the City could never obtaine any account thereof, according to their right. That therfore a just and strict account may be forthwith given to all the Free-men of any those dead stocks, and yet whereas there hath been nothing paid out of those, nor for the Lands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the City, whiles the estates of others have been much wasted, by continuall payments, that therfore proportionable summes to what other estates have paid, may be taken out of those dead stocks, and lands which would amount to such vast summes, as would pay much of the Souldiers Arreares, without burthening the oppressed people.</p>
            <p>And it is further offered, that Forrest Lands, and Deanes and Chapters lands, bee immediately set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the Arrears of the Army, and that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of these, and the residue of Bishops lands unfold, till the time of sale, may be forthwith appointed to be paid unto our Treasury, to be reserved for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers constant pay.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:161228:3"/>
            <p>And it's to be wished that onely such part of the aforesaid lands be sold as necessity requires, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Souldiery for arreares, and that the residue bee reserved and improved for a constant revenue for the State, that the people may not be burthened, and that out of the revenues publique debts may be paid, and not first taken out of their own purses to be repaid to them.</p>
            <p>And it's further offered for the peoples ease, that the arrears of all former assessements be duly collected from those who have sufficient estates, and have not beene impoverished by the war.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And whereas it is conceived that the Fees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of customes and Excise if they were justly computed, would amount to neere as much as the Armies pay, it's therfore offered that speedy consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation be had of the multitude of those officers, and of their excessive fees, and profits, as 500. 600. 1000. 1200. l. <hi>per annum.</hi> As also that many Excize men appoint whom they please as their substitute, and allow what they please for their pay, that the officers may be few, and constant stipends allowed them, none exceeding 200. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> that so more moneys may be brought into the publique treasury.</p>
            <p>And for the ease and satisfaction of the people, it's further to be insisted on, that the charge of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be kept up in the kingdome by sea or land, be particularly computed and published, and that all taxes that shall be necessary, may be wholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, according to that charge; and there be an equall rate propounded throughout the Kingdome in all assessements, that so one towne may not beare double the proportion of another of the same value.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:161228:4"/>
            <p n="4">IV. That all Monopolyes be forthwith removed, and no persons whatsoever may be permitted to restraine others from free trade.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the most sad oppressions of prisoners be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with eased and removed, and that no person that hath no estate reall or personall, nor any person that shall willingly yeeld up his estate to satisfie his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may be detained in prison to the ruine of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and families, and likewise, that no person impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in a criminall cause, may be detained from his legall tryall any longer that the next Tearme</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That all Statutes for the Common Prayer booke, and for enforcing all to come to Church, wherby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious and conscientious people are daily vexed and oppressed, be forthwith repealed and nulled. As also that all Statutes against Conventicles, under the pretence of which, religious people are vexed for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings about the worship of God, may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise repealed and nulled.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That all the oppressive statutes, enforcing all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons though against their consciences to pay Tythes, whereby the Husband man cannot eate the fruit of his labour, may be repealed and nulled.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That all statutes enforcing the taking of oathes, as in Townes corporate, the oath of Supremacy, &amp;c. Wherein either the whole oath, or some clauses in them, are burthens and snares to consciencious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be repealed and nulled.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:161228:4"/>
            <p n="9">XI. That it be declared that no person or Court shal have power to be permitted to enforce any person to make oath, or answer to any Interrogatories concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe, in any criminall case.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That a Committee of conscientious persons bee forthwith selected to consider of the most intollerable oppressions by unjust proceedings in the Law, that withall the lawes might be reduced to a smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to bee comprized in one volume in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, that every free Commoner might understand his owne proceedings, that Courts might be set up in the respective Counties or Hundreds, that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might become short and speedy, and that the numberlesse grievances in the law and Lawyers, might be redressed as soone as possible.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That all priveledges and protections above the law, whereby some persons are exempted from the force and power thereof, to the insufferable vexation and ruine of multitudes of distressed people, may bee forthwith abbrogated.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That all the antient rights and donations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the poor, now imbezled and converted to other uses, as inclosed Commons, Alms-houses, &amp;c. throughout all parts of the Land, may be forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the antient publique use and service of the poore, in whose hands soever they be detained.</p>
